#day1 of python
python is a high level programming language
python has indentation concept i.e the space of beginning of a line
comments can be used to explain the code,makes the code more readable and prevents the execution when testing the code
comments are created by using #-"yash"

#PYTHON VARIABLES
variables are used to store the data
python has no commands to declare the variables
variable is created when you assign value to it
ex:x=1
variables doesn't need to be decalred with particular data type,even they can change datatype after declaring
we can assign value to multiple variables in a single line
ex:x,y,z="orange","banana","apple"
we can assign same value to multiple variables in single line
ex:x,y,z="grapes"
print() function is used to produce output for variables
variables that are created outside the function is known as global variables
to  create global variable inside the function we can use "global" keyword

#RULES FOR PYTHON VARIABLES
variables must start with a letter or an underscore character but cannot start with a number
variables can contain alpha numeric characters and underscore
variable name cannot be any python keyword
variable names are case-sensitive
ex:age,Age and AGE are three different variables

#MULTIWORD VARIBLE NAMES
CAMEL CASE:
each word,except the first will start with a capital letter
ex: myVariableName="sravan"
PASCAL CASE:
each word will start with a capital letter
ex:MyVariableName="sravan"
SNAKE CASE:
